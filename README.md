# re-post

A basic web-app built with Clojure and Clojurescript.

The server uses [Ring][https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring] and [Compojure][https://github.com/weavejester/compojure] for routing requests.

The web-client is React.js in cljs, using [Reagent][https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent] for views and [Re-frame][https://github.com/day8/re-frame] for managing events and data.

The re-frame README and [docs][https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/tree/master/docs] are a great way to learn about writing pure functional web-apps.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start the development web server for the application, run:

`lein up`
